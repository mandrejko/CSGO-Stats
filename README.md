# CSGO Stats
This is my final project for my Mobile App Development course I took during J-Term 2015.

##Firebase
The point of this project was to use Firebase in order to learn how to work with NoSql. Previously, our curriculum focused on standard, relational databases. 

##Usage
The user can manually input their stats from their matches of Counter Strike: Global Offensive to keep track of how well they do on each map.
